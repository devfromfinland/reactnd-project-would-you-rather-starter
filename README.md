# Would You Rather Project

This is the project #2 of the course Udacity's React nanodegree. This project focuses on React/Redux state management to build a 'would you rather ...' game.

**The game's features**
- Answer 'would you rather...' questions
- Create new 'would you rather...' questions
- Check leaderboard to see ranking from all users

Initial code retrieve the `_DATA.js` file as starter. This file acts as a backend server. However, it doesn't alter the database so the app will always start with its initial data.

Project is create by using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## To run the project:
```
npm install
npm start
```
